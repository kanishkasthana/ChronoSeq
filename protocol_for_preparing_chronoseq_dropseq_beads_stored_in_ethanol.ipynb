    "#### Storage of ChronoSeq or Dropseq beads\n",
    "+ You should receive your beads suspended in Ethanol.\n",
    "+ Store these beads in a new box at -20&deg;C before you start your experiments or for long term storage. Label the box with the Date you received the beads, the bead type and the batch number.\n",

    "+ We suggest preparing [3.33X Lysis Buffer Stock using this protocol,](protocol_for_preparing_3.33X_lysis_buffer_stock.ipynb) before you get started.\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "1. Remember to put back the reagents back to their storage location at 4&deg;C or -20&deg;C once you are done with using them.\n",
    "2. Get fresh new microtips/sterile-disposable pipettes after each step, unless mentioned otherwise. \n",
