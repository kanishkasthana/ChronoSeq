    "## Instructions for Assembling LG16-1000D Sensirion Flow Sensor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Description and Working Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We need precise control of Flow Rates going into our Microfluidic Chip for Droplet Generation.\n",
    "    + Flow Rates can be changed by Changing the Gas Pressure in each Channel.\n",
    "    + Flow Rates are measured using Flow Sensors/Flow Meters.\n",
    "+ We need 3 Flow Meters for each injection Channel: Bead, Cell and Oil Channels.\n",
    "+ The Sensirion [LG16-1000D](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/LG16-1000D) Flow Sensor tells us Flow rates in the 0-1000&mu;l range.\n",
    "+ The Flow Sensor works by measuring heat transfer. \n",
    "+ This heat transfer can vary depending on the Dissolved Chemicals or Fluid Being used, therefore this sensor needs to be Calibrated before use.\n",
    "+ We have already calculated some Calibration values for this Sensor but it might be useful to Check the Calibration.\n",
    "+ We will learn how to check this Calibration in a separate notebook.\n",
    "+ We use the Sensirion Flow Sensor for the Bead Channel Only.\n",
    "+ There is a Thin Glass Capillary inside the Flow Sensor, overtightening can cause this to break. Please follow any [precautions mentioned in the datasheet](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/690EAAD4/61658721/Sensirion_Liquid_Flow_Meters_LG16_xxxxD_Datasheet.pdf).\n",

    "### 3D Printing Sensor Housing\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We used a [Bambu Lab X1 Carbon](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon?variant=42698346070152) to print the Housing.\n",
    "    + 0.4mm Nozzle\n",
    "    + Textured PEI Plate \n",
    "+ We generated a [3MF File](CAD_Files/Sensirion%20LG16-1000D%20Flow%20Sensor/LG16-1000D%20Sensirion%20Housing%20With%20Arduino%20Nano.3mf) with all the Settings we used for the Print. You can open this file on the [Orca Slicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases).\n",
    "+ The Original STEP Files and F3D Files can be found in [this directory](CAD_Files/Sensirion%20LG16-1000D%20Flow%20Sensor).\n",
    "+ We recommend getting a [3D Printing Accessories Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VBNDF95/) if you haven't purchased one already.\n",
    "    + Its extremely helpful in removing supports and cleaning up the print.\n",
    "+ You can watch the Timelapse Video Below:"
