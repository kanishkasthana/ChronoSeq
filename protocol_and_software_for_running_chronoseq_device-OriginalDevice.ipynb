    "1. **Bead structure:** Modified from the [Dropseq](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00549-8) beads, our beads contain cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Our beads also have an additional Time-Tag common for each Bead Reservoir. \n",
    "2. **Droplet generation:** Cells and time-tagged beads are co-injected into a microfluidic chip that uses [inertial ordering](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7LC01284E) to co-encapsulate one bead with one cell in each droplet. \n",
    "3. and 4. **Cell lysis and molecular capture:** Upon droplet formation, cells are lysed, releasing their mRNA. These are captured by the PolyT region on the beads. \n",
    "5. **Sample processing:** Droplets are collected and kept on ice until all time points are sampled. Droplets are then broken, and beads are combined, followed by a combined reverse transcription reaction. \n",
    "6. **Library preparation.** A RNA-Seq library is prepared. This is then followed by tagmentation and sequencing adapter addition.\n",
    "7. and 8. **Sequencing and data analysis:** After sequencing, a Digital data matrix is created. Time-tags are assigned to each cell barcode, allowing temporal analysis of gene expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design of equipment.\n",
    "Our device design addresses several challenges not present in the original Dropseq system (See Figure Below). First, extended cell viability. We maintain cell suspension viability for experiments lasting 2 hours or longer, compared to typical 30-minute Drop-seq runs. Second, cross-contamination prevention. We implemented a washing system to remove unused cells or beads between samples. Third, sample isolation. We designed a system to prevent mixing wash fluid with droplets. To address these challenges, our device operates in two main phases during each injection cycle. 1. Flushing phase that clears fluid lines of residual beads or cells from previous injections. 2. Injection phase that precisely introduces cells and time-tagged beads into the microfluidic chip. This integrated system enables controlled, sequential introduction of cells and time-tagged beads, capturing gene expression dynamics across multiple time points in a single experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Figure above compares the ChronoSeq device (A) with Dropseq device (B). \n",
    "The ChronoSeq device is controlled via serial connections to a computer, which coordinates the actions of its various components, while the Dropseq device works by setting flow rates manually on syringe pumps. Some key features distinguish the ChronoSeq device:\n",
    "1. **Bead handling:** ChronoSeq incorporates an automated vortex mixer to keep the beads evenly suspended before injection. Dropseq uses a magnetic stirrer for bead suspension, which leads to high dead volumes and complicates automation for multiple time-tags. ChronoSeq allows for the easy addition of more time-tags in the future if necessary. Additionally, loading and unloading the beads is simplified; we can directly screw a new 50 mL tube containing beads into the reservoir. The time-tagged bead reservoirs are connected to timepoint valves, which facilitate the selection of the appropriate time-tagged beads for injection into the microfluidic chip. \n",
    "2. **Cell culture system:** In the Dropseq device, cells are directly loaded into a syringe for injection, typically running for 15 to 30 minutes. However, our goal is to maintain cell viability for at least 2 hours. Leaving cells at room temperature without growth media and in the absence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> can lead to excessive cell death and unwanted perturbations. To address this, we have integrated a cell culture system directly into the ChronoSeq device, featuring a water bath to maintain cells at 37&deg;C, along with a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> gas cylinder that serves as a pressure source and aids in cell culture. Furthermore, we can add additional tubes to culture multiple cell suspensions separately and use valves to select which cell suspension is injected into the microfluidic chip. \n",
    "3. **Droplet collection:** In the Dropseq device, droplets are collected directly in a 50 mL tube kept on ice. However, in our system, it is crucial to prevent the beads and cells from previous injections from mixing with those from new injections. To achieve this, we developed a washing system to clear the fluid lines of residual beads and cells. We also need to ensure that washing liquids and unused cell suspensions do not mix with the collected droplets. To solve this issue, we designed a robotic system that facilitates droplet collection and bead recovery. This robot automatically moves the outlet tubing to the correct tube, preventing the mixing of droplets with washing fluids. Additionally, it can recover unused beads from the fluid lines, minimizing waste and reducing experimental costs. Like the Dropseq device, the droplets in our system are also kept on ice using ice boxes. \n",
    "4. **Flow control:** In the Dropseq device, precise speed control is essential for droplet formation. Speeds that are too high can inhibit droplet formation, while low speeds can negatively impact throughput. To achieve this precise control, Dropseq employs syringe pumps, which allow direct manipulation of the syringe's squeezing rate. In our case, we require high flow rates for flushing and low flow rates for droplet formation. Low flow rates like Dropseq flow rates, are insufficient for quickly washing unused beads and cells from the device. Therefore, we implemented a compressed air pressure controller and flow sensors for each of the bead, cell, and oil channels. The compressed air controller enables rapid changes in flow rate, while the flow sensors provide the precise control needed for high-quality droplet formation during low flow rate operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microfluidic Chip Design\n",
    "The primary function of the microfluidic chip is to co-encapsulate cells with time-tagged beads using a [flow-focusing junction](https://doi.org/10.1002/elps.200500173) at the center of the chip. While we initially considered using the Dropseq microfluidic chip for this purpose, several limitations made it unsuitable for our application: \n",
    "1. **Ordering mechanism:** Dropseq relies on random (Poisson) ordering for co-encapsulation of cells and beads. This random ordering makes it difficult to increase the number of cells collected per timepoint without also increasing droplets containing multiple cells or beads. The ChronoSeq microfluidic chip uses an optimized version of an [existing inertial ordering design](https://doi.org/10.1039/C7LC01284E), to increase cell capture through deterministic ordering of beads into droplets. This deterministic ordering allows for capturing more cells by increasing the number of droplets containing exactly one bead and one cell. \n",
    "2. **Channel design:** Both the Dropseq chip and existing inertial ordering designs use narrow flow resistance channels, which are prone to blockage during the flushing phase of the ChronoSeq device. To reduce blockage risk, we widened the channels in our chip design. To maintain the same flow resistance with wider channels, we increased the length of the channels to compensate (See Figure Below).\n",
    "3. **Quality Control:** We implemented a rigorous quality control protocol: compressed air testing to check for delamination and eliminate leaking chips, simulating the high pressures used during the flushing phase; visual inspection to ensure the absence of particles before connecting to the device. These design and quality control measures enable the chips to withstand higher pressures and cyclical pressurization during the flushing phase. The optimized chip design is crucial for reliable, high-throughput, time-resolved single-cell sequencing. The improvements in channel geometry and manufacturing process contribute to reduced clogging, increased cell capture efficiency, overall system robustness. These features are essential for maintaining consistent performance across multiple time points and ensuring high-quality data collection throughout extended experimental runs.\n",

The first Part of the scheduleList is the name of the schedule function. The second value is the number of times you want to repeat that schedule. The third value is the duration of the schedule. Execution will stop as soon as this amount of time is reached.\n",

This generally happens when the chip is too old, the height of the channels is less than 102&mu;m or if the Aquapel treatment has worn off.\n",
    "    + The outlet tubing is about to come out. This mean you probably didn't push the tubing far down to ensure the seal doesn't break. Your punches holes in the PDMS might be too wide or your tubing too thin. Please follow instruction and use the Exact tubing and Punches when making the PDMS Chips. The Droplets will start leaking out if the Outlet tubing pops out. Push the Outlet tubing in slightly but not all the way in, if you fear this might happen.\n",
