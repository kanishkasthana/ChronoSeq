    "### Getting Started with Software \n",
    "+ Install [Git X86-64-Bit for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and [Anaconda X86-64-Bit for Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/download), on your [Windows X86-64 Bit PC](Computer%20Selection.md).\n",
    "+ Type \"Git Bash\" in the Search bar next to the Start Button. Using Git Bash clone this repository.\n",
    "    + Using Git Bash [Navigate to the directory](https://tutorials.codebar.io/command-line/introduction/tutorial.html) where you want to store this repository.\n",
    "    + This repository has submodules. In Git Bash, use the command ```> git clone --recursive https://github.com/kanishkasthana/ChronoSeq.git```  when cloning this repository so the submodules are also cloned.\n",
    "+ Type \"Anaconda Prompt\" in the Search bar next to the Start Button. Now create a [new environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) called Chrono from [this file](conda_environment_file/chrono.env.yml)\n",
    "+ [Activate the Environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment) from the Anaconda Prompt. \n",
    "+ Using the Anaconda Prompt navigate to the directory for the git repository you cloned.\n",
    "    + Alternatively you can modify your Anaconda Prompt shortcut so that it always activates the Chrono Environment and launches at the location of your Git repository. I've included [an example here](conda_environment_file/Anaconda%20Prompt.lnk).\n",
    "    + Open Run and type ```shell:startup``` to open your startup folder.<br><img src=\"img/Screenshot%202024-10-24%20184651.png\">\n",
    "    + You can copy the shortcut included to this startup folder.\n",
    "    + Then right click the shortcut and change the ```Target``` and ```Start In``` sections so that a command line terminal with the environment automatically activated opens during startup.<br><img src=\"img/Screenshot%202024-10-24%20184946.png\">\n",
    "+ Using Anaconda Prompt Run ```> jupyter notebook``` \n",
    "+ The links to the notebooks below are intended to be opened using Jupyter. Click the image below to watch a video of the process.\n",

    "### Overview of Technology and Workflow\n",
    "+ [This notebook](ChronoSeq_Overview.ipynb) provides an overview of ChronoSeq technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Device Assembly\n",
    "+ See the [Device Assembly and Setup notebook](instructions_for_device_assembly_and_setup.ipynb) for a detailed description of how to set everything up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage of Dropseq beads upon receipt\n",
    "+ You should receive your beads suspended in Ethanol.\n",
    "+ Store these beads in a new box at -20&deg;C before you start your experiments or for long term storage. Label the box with the Date you received the beads, the bead type and the batch number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the Device and Preparation for Experiment\n",
    "+ Once you are ready, see [this notebook](protocol_and_software_for_running_chronoseq_device.ipynb#Protocol-for-Preparation-and-Operation-of-the-ChronoSeq-Device-for-an-Experiment.) on how to run the Device and the preparation needed.\n",
