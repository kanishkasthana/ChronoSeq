    "+ See the [Troubleshooting Section in the PDMS bonding notebook](protocol_for_bonding_pdms_chips_to_glass.ipynb#Troubleshooting-Poor-Bonding/Delamination-During-Aquapel-Treatment) for help.\n",
    "+ Unfortunately PDMS is a finicky material and there can be significant differences between batches in terms of bonding efficiency. We have had anything from 15% to 100% Yeilds between different batches. \n",
    "+ To combat these reliability issues we will try to make injection molded Microfluidic chips available in the future.\n",
    "+ If you find a batch of PDMS that works really well for you, we suggest you make a lot of chips at the same time using that batch.\n",
