I want to thank Garrett Graham. Garrett was a fellow Graduate Student at the time and did not need to help me but he did so regardless. He showed me how to get started with SU-8 Photolithography and was a great help. Want to also thank Shu Xiang for hosting the SU-8 Photolithography course at UCSD Nano3.
