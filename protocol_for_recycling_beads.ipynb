    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "1. Remember to put back the reagents back to their storage location at 4&deg;C or -20&deg;C once you are done with using them.\n",
    "2. Get fresh new microtips/sterile-disposable pipettes after each step, unless mentioned otherwise. \n",
    "      + Important to avoid cross-contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equipment Used:\n",
    "+  Our lab uses the refrigerated [Sorval ST8R Centrifuge](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/75007200). You can find [CAD files to print some of the parts here](CAD_Files/Sorval%20ST8R%20CAD%20Models).\n",
    "    + We bought the 50ml Inserts and Printed the Rest.\n",
    "    + You can modify the CAD files to print the 50ml Inserts as well. \n",
    "    + Use PLA or TPU for the prints.\n",
