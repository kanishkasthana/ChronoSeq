    "Sequences are added by using an oligo that binds to the existing PolyT region on Drop-seq beads. The 3’ end of the Drop-seq beads are then extended to the reverse compliment of the oligo using E. Coli DNA Polymerase I. Single-stranded DNA are removed using Exonuclease 1. This leaves only double-stranded DNA on the beads that cannot capture RNA. Therefore, Alkaline denaturation is used to make the double stranded DNA single-stranded. These beads are then resuspended in lysis buffer and can be used directly with our device.\n",
