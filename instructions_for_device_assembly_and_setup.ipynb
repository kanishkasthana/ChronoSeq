    "# Instructions for the ChronoSeq Device assembly from Individual Components\n",
    "### Design of equipment.\n",
    "Our device design addresses several challenges not present in the original <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(15)00549-8\">Dropseq</a> system (See Figure Below). First, extended cell viability. We maintain cell suspension viability for experiments lasting 2 hours or longer, compared to typical 30-minute Dropseq runs. Second, cross-contamination prevention. We implemented a washing system to remove unused cells or beads between samples. Third, sample isolation. We designed a system to prevent mixing wash fluid with droplets. To address these challenges, our device operates in two main phases during each injection cycle. 1. Flushing phase that clears fluid lines of residual beads or cells from previous injections. 2. Injection phase that precisely introduces cells and time-tagged beads into the microfluidic chip. This integrated system enables controlled, sequential introduction of cells and time-tagged beads, capturing gene expression dynamics across multiple time points in a single experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Figure above compares the ChronoSeq device (A) with Dropseq device (B). \n",
    "The ChronoSeq device is controlled via serial connections to a computer, which coordinates the actions of its various components, while the Dropseq device works by setting flow rates manually on syringe pumps. Some key features distinguish the ChronoSeq device:\n",
    "1. **Bead handling:** ChronoSeq incorporates an automated vortex mixer to keep the beads evenly suspended before injection. Dropseq uses a magnetic stirrer for bead suspension, which leads to high dead volumes and complicates automation for multiple time-tags. ChronoSeq allows for the easy addition of more time-tags in the future if necessary. Additionally, loading and unloading the beads is simplified; we can directly screw a new 50 mL tube containing beads into the reservoir. The time-tagged bead reservoirs are connected to timepoint valves, which facilitate the selection of the appropriate time-tagged beads for injection into the microfluidic chip. \n",
    "2. **Cell culture system:** In the Dropseq device, cells are directly loaded into a syringe for injection, typically running for 15 to 30 minutes. However, our goal is to maintain cell viability for at least 2 hours. Leaving cells at room temperature without growth media and in the absence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> can lead to excessive cell death and unwanted perturbations. To address this, we have integrated a cell culture system directly into the ChronoSeq device, featuring a water bath to maintain cells at 37&deg;C, along with a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> gas cylinder that serves as a pressure source and aids in cell culture. Furthermore, we can add additional tubes to culture multiple cell suspensions separately and use valves to select which cell suspension is injected into the microfluidic chip. \n",
    "3. **Droplet collection:** In the Dropseq device, droplets are collected directly in a 50 mL tube kept on ice. However, in our system, it is crucial to prevent the beads and cells from previous injections from mixing with those from new injections. To achieve this, we developed a washing system to clear the fluid lines of residual beads and cells. We also need to ensure that washing liquids and unused cell suspensions do not mix with the collected droplets. To solve this issue, we designed a robotic system that facilitates droplet collection and bead recovery. This robot automatically moves the outlet tubing to the correct tube, preventing the mixing of droplets with washing fluids. Additionally, it can recover unused beads from the fluid lines, minimizing waste and reducing experimental costs. Like the Dropseq device, the droplets in our system are also kept on ice using ice boxes. \n",
    "4. **Flow control:** In the Dropseq device, precise speed control is essential for droplet formation. Speeds that are too high can inhibit droplet formation, while low speeds can negatively impact throughput. To achieve this precise control, Dropseq employs syringe pumps, which allow direct manipulation of the syringe's squeezing rate. In our case, we require high flow rates for flushing and low flow rates for droplet formation. Low flow rates like Dropseq flow rates, are insufficient for quickly washing unused beads and cells from the device. Therefore, we implemented a compressed air pressure controller and flow sensors for each of the bead, cell, and oil channels. The compressed air controller enables rapid changes in flow rate, while the flow sensors provide the precise control needed for high-quality droplet formation during low flow rate operation.\n",

    "    + You can find the [3MF and CAD files for Valve Holders here](CAD_Files/Valve%20Holders).\n",
