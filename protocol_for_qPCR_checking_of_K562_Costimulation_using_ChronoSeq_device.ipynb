    "\n",
    "### Cell Culture and Cell Preparation\n",
    "+ We will need to culture THP-1 cells and K562 Cells for this experiment. \n",
    "+ Make sure you have enough K562 Cells on the day of the experiment to make at least 7ml of K562 at 430cells/&mu;l\n",
    "+ We will follow the [Bowdish lab protocol for culturing THP-1 Cells](http://www.bowdish.ca/lab/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/THP-1-propagation-culture.pdf)\n",
    "+ Make complete growth media with 10%FBS, 1%PEN-STREP, and 0.05mM (1X)[2-Mercaptoethanol](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/gibco-2-mercaptoethanol-55mm/21985023) with [ATCC Formulation of RPMI 1640](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/gibco-rpmi-1640-medium-atcc-modification-hepes-liquid/A1049101).\n",
    "+ The goal of this experiment is to see if K562 cells can be stimulated by THP-1 Cells through Paracrine signalling.\n",
    "+ We will use vented Tissue Culture Treated T12.5 Flasks for this experiment.\n",
    "+ Four days before the experiment(preferably on a Friday) prepare 40ml of THP-1 cells 430cells/&mu;l.\n",
    "    + Spin down the cells and use fresh complete growth media.\n",
    "    + Resuspend the cells then 40&mu;m filter the cells.\n",
    "    + Count the cells and resuspend at 430cells/&mu;l.\n",
    "+ Load the cells into the ChronoSeq device and leave with Vent On with regular blowout to clear condensation every 2 hours for a total of three days.\n",
    "    + Make sure there is a Magnetic Stirring disk in the Tube.\n",
    "+ Add 0.4&mu;l of PMA 10mM stock.Press down till second stop. The magnetic stirring disk should ensure good mixing.\n",
    "+ Make sure you have enough 5%CO<sub>2</sub> in the Gas Cylinder to last the entire duration of the experiment.\n",
    "+ Take a 20&mu;l sample of cells every day to check for clumping.\n",
    "+ One the third day we will spin down the cells and try to break clumps through trypsinization if necessary. Then:\n",
    "    + We will resuspend the cells after washing twice with PMA-Free media. \n",
    "    + Resuspend at 430cells/ul and then leave for 1 day as a resting period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On Day of Experiment \n",
    "+ Make 6 K562 Flasks with DMEM 1%PEN-STREP with 0.9ml of K562 Cells in each:\n",
    "    + We will label these flasks 3hr, 2hr, 1hr, 0hr, No Stimulation and TNF&alpha;\n",
    "+ Make a 7th flask with 5ml of DMEM 1%PEN-STREP for later use for control experiments.\n",
    "+ Make enough Lysis reagent for 7 samples and keep on ice.\n",
    "+ Thaw LPS and TNF&alpha; Vials and then keep on ice.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Cell Lysis\n",
    "+ We will follow a protocol [similar to SingleShot Cell Lysis Kit](https://www.bio-rad.com/sites/default/files/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10000112808.pdf) but we will not change our media to DPBS.\n",
    "+ Prepare 6 PCR Tubes for Cell Lysis as follows and keep these Tubes on ice while your prepare. For each tube:\n",
    "    + Label the Tubes 3H,2H,1H,0H,NS,TNF.\n",
    "    + 48&mu;l Single Shot Cell Lysis Buffer\n",
    "    + 1&mu;l Proteinase K Solution\n",
    "    + 1&mu;l DNase Solution\n",
    "+ For each tube we will:\n",
    "    + Add 5&mu;l of Cell Suspension. Mix Well. This is equivalent to 1075 K562 Cells.\n",
    "    + Keep the tube back on ice till you have collected all 6 samples.\n",
    "   \n",
    "+ We need to take both 0hr and 1hr samples for K562 as well. This will help calculate the impact of residual THP-1 cells in the supernatant as well. We will only take 0.1ml Samples of THP-1 cells to conserve the amount left for our experiment.\n",
