    "+ Bio-Rad CFX Opus 96 \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cell Culture and Cell Preparation\n",
    "+ We will need to culture THP-1 cells and K562 Cells for this experiment. \n",
    "+ Make sure you have enough K562 Cells on the day of the experiment to make at least 15ml of K562 at 430cells/&mu;l\n",
    "+ We will follow the [Bowdish lab protocol for culturing THP-1 Cells](http://www.bowdish.ca/lab/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/THP-1-propagation-culture.pdf)\n",
    "+ Make complete growth media with 10%FBS, 1%PEN-STREP, and 0.05mM (1X)[2-Mercaptoethanol](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/gibco-2-mercaptoethanol-55mm/21985023) with [ATCC Formulation of RPMI 1640](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/gibco-rpmi-1640-medium-atcc-modification-hepes-liquid/A1049101).\n",
    "+ The goal of this experiment is to see if K562 cells can be stimulated by THP-1 Cells through Paracrine signalling.\n",
    "+ We will use vented Tissue Culture Treated T25 Flasks for this experiment.\n",
    "+ Four days before the experiment(preferably on a Friday) prepare four T25 flasks with 3ml of THP-1 cells at 430cells/&mu;l.\n",
    "    + Label these flasks 3hr, 2hr, 1hr and 0hr.\n",
    "+ Make PMA Stock by adding 1&mu;l of 10mM PMA to 1ml of Culture Media. This will give you a 10&mu;M stock. We need to make the final concentration 100nM for the flasks. So for this purpose we will add 30&mu;l of this stock to each Flask.\n",
    "+ Now leave the cells to adhere and differenciate and come back on Monday. On Monday we will:\n",
    "    + Remove the Media and dead cells then wash the cells twice with 3ml of fresh Culture Media.\n",
    "    + Be careful not to detach and cells. Make sure the final volume is still 3ml.\n",
    "    + Leave the cells for 24 hours to rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On Day of Experiment \n",
    "+ Keep DMEM 1%PEN-STEP in Water bath and Turn UV ON in Cell Culture hood for 15minutes before getting started.\n",
    "+ Thaw LPS Stock Tube and TNF&alpha; Stock Tube and keep on ice.\n",
    "+ Wash all THP-1 Flasks with Serum Free DMEM 1%PEN-STREP twice.\n",
    "    + Make sure final volume is still 3ml. \n",
    "    + Don't detach the cells.\n",
    "+ We will prepare 6 T25 Flasks of K562 Cells at 430Cells/ul at 2ml each. K562 Cells will be suspended in DMEM 1%PEN-STREP.\n",
    "    + These will be labeled K562: 3hr, 2hr, 1hr, 0hr, No Stimulation, TNF&alpha;\n",
    "+ Keep all Flasks in 37&deg;C incubator while we wait.\n",
    "    + Put another flask with 10ml of DMEM 1%PEN-STREP only also in the incubator.\n",
    "+ Now we will add 3&mu;l of LPS from the stock tube to get 1&mu;g of LPS/ml in the following order:\n",
    "    + First add to 3hr THP-1.\n",
    "    + After 1 hour add to 2hr THP-1\n",
    "    + After another 1 hour add to 1hr THP-1\n",
    "    + After another 1 hour add to 0hr THP-1\n",
    "+ We will immediately transfer the following volumes to K562 Flasks:\n",
    "    + Add 2ml Supernatant only from 3hr THP-1 to K562 3hr\n",
    "    + Add 2ml Supernatant only from 2hr THP-1 to K562 2hr\n",
    "    + Add 2ml Supernatant only from 1hr THP-1 to K562 1hr\n",
    "    + Add 2ml Supernatant only from 0hr THP-1 to K562 0hr\n",
    "    + Add 2ml DMEM 1%PEN-STREP from Incubator to K562 No Stimulation\n",
    "    + Add 2ml DMEM 1%PEN-STREP from Incubator to K562 TNF&alpha; and then add 4&mu;l of TNF&alpha; from the stock to get a final concentration of 10ng/ml.\n",
    "+ We will now wait for 1 hour before doing the Cell Lysis part for qPCR. This should provide enough time for the K562 cells to respond to the signalling molecules in the Supernatant.\n",
    "+ You can prepare Cell Lysis Solution stock while you wait. Make enough for 7 Tubes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Cell Lysis\n",
    "+ We will follow a protocol [similar to SingleShot Cell Lysis Kit](https://www.bio-rad.com/sites/default/files/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10000112808.pdf) but we will not change our media to DPBS.\n",
    "+ Prepare 6 PCR Tubes for Cell Lysis as follows and keep these Tubes on ice while your prepare. For each tube:\n",
    "    + Label the Tubes 3H,2H,1H,0H,NS,TNF.\n",
    "    + 48&mu;l Single Shot Cell Lysis Buffer\n",
    "    + 1&mu;l Proteinase K Solution\n",
    "    + 1&mu;l DNase Solution\n",
    "+ For each tube:\n",
    "    + Add 5&mu;l of Cell Suspension. Mix Well. This is equivalent to 1075 K562 Cells.\n",
    "    + Keep the tube back on ice till you have collected all 6 samples.\n",
    "+ Spin down all the Tubes.\n",
    "    + Using a PCR Machine run the following program:\n",
    "        + Lid Temperature 105&deg;C\n",
    "        + Volume 55&mu;l\n",
    "        + Incubate for 10 min at 21&deg;C\n",
    "        + Followed by 5 min at 37°C,\n",
    "        + 5 min at 75°C.\n",
    "        + 4&deg;C for &infin;\n",
    "    + The cell lysate can be stored on ice for up to 4 hr, at -20°C for up to 2 months, or at -80°C for up to 12 months.\n",
    "    + After PCR Immediately store the Tubes at -80&deg;C\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single Step RT-qPCR\n",
    "+ Adapted [from existing protocol here](https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10032048.pdf).\n",
    "+ The iTaq kit comes with ROX as a background reference dye so remember to set that in your qPCR machine. ROX is not necessary for Bio-Rad CFX Opus 96. \n",
    "+ For each conditon you will have to setup 4 qPCR reactions. Two replicates for each gene NFKBIA and ACTB. For each 20&mu;l reaction PCR Tube:\n",
    "    + iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green reaction mix 2X: 10&mu;l\n",
    "    + 1&mu;l PrimePCR Assay primers (20X).\n",
    "    + iScript reverse transcriptase 0.25&mu;l\n",
    "    + 4&mu;l Cell Lysate.\n",
    "    + 4.75&mu;l Nuclease Free Water\n",
    "+ Setup the qPCR reaction as follows: \n",
    "    + 10min at 50&deg;C for Reverse Transcription.\n",
    "    + 1min at 95&deg;C for DNA denaturation and Polymerse activation.\n",
    "    + 40 Cycles of:\n",
    "        + 95&deg;C 10seconds Denaturation\n",
    "        + 60&deg;C 30seconds Annealing and Plate Read\n",
    "+ After the plate setup. The plate was sealed with a Optically clear adhesive film.\n",
    "    + Make sure the lips are completely sealed to avoid leaks. Then vortex the plate.\n",
    "+ Plate was then spun down and loaded into the qPCR machine.\n",
    "+ Run the Program."
