    "\n",
    "### Brief Description of Purpose and Working Principles:\n",
    "+ We need to a way to control the flow of liquid through the ChronoSeq Device by shutting down or redirecting flow.\n",
    "+ To help control the flow with our computer we need to build a Valve Controller that can switch specific valves ON or OFF when it receives a command from the computer.\n",
    "+ The SMC Valves we have selected for our device can be 2:2 Valves or 3:2 Valves. \n",
    "    + 2:2 Valves Turn Flow ON or OFF. Most of these will be used to control flow from Individual Reservoirs.\n",
    "    + 3:2 Valves Redirect Flow from the Input Port to the Main or Bypass Port. We use these as Bypass Valves for Controlling flow into the Microfluidic Chip for each Channel: Cells, Beads and Oil. \n",
    "+ The 2:2 SMC Valves we have purchased are Normally Closed (NC). Meaning liquid will only flow through them when they are powered ON.\n",
    "+ The 3:2 Valves allow flow from:\n",
    "    + The Input Port to the Bypass port when powered OFF. The Bypass port is therefore called the Normally Open (NO) Port.\n",
    "    + You can identify the NO Port by Looking for the NO Symbol on the Valve near the Port.\n",
    "    + The Valve allows flow from the Input port to the Main port only when powered ON. This port is therefore called the Normally Closed (NC) Port.\n",
    "    + You can identify the NC Port by Looking for the NC Symbol on the Valve near the Port.\n",
    "    + The 3:2 Valves can be converted into 2:2 NC or 2:2 NO Valves by blocking either the NC or NO Port using a [Delrin Plug](https://www.idex-hs.com/store/product-detail/plug_delrin_1_4_28_flat_bottom/p-309).\n",

    "### Ordering Information for SMC Valves\n",
    "+ SMC Valves are Highly Configurable and the exact product number represents this configuration.\n",
    "    + For Example [this website](https://www.smcusa.com/products/lvm10-100-2-3-port-solenoid-valve-for-chemicals~136614) allows you to generate a product number before ordering.\n",
    "    + Make sure the Chemicals being used for your application are compatible with the Wetted materials in your Valve Configuration.\n",
    "+ We will be ordering the [LVM10 Series of Valves](https://content2.smcetech.com/pdf/LVM_new.pdf). \n",
    "+ The Following product numbers and Quantities were ordered for the two types for Valves:\n",
    "    + 2:2 Valves: LVM10R6-5A2U . Quantity : 30 Units \n",
    "        + 22 Units are needed in the Version of the ChronoSeq Device with 16 Timepoint Reservoirs.\n",
    "        + The remaining 8 were kept as backup replacements.\n",
    "        + You can order only 22 Valves if you want to save some money.\n",
    "        + Only 18 Valves are necessary if your device has 12 Timepoint Reservoirs.\n",
    "    + 3:2 Valves: LVM105R-5A2U . Quantity :  5 Units\n",
    "        + 3 Units are needed in the Current Version of the ChronoSeq Device.\n",
    "        + The remaining 2 were kept as backup replacements.\n",
    "        + You can order only 3 Valves if you want to save some money.\n",
    "+ SMC has many global suppliers and your local supplier might vary.\n",
    "    + Different suppliers offer different prices.\n",
    "    + Its best to find the most competitive local supplier for your area.\n",
    "    + You can use [this website](https://www.smcusa.com/contact/distributor-locator) to help you locate a supplier.\n",
    "+ We ordered our valves from [Bay Advanced Technologies](https://www.bayat.com/) located in Orange County, CA.\n",
    "    + Its best to call them to place an order. Their number is +1 714-241-1031 . \n",
    "    + You should also email [Monica(mgparra@bayat.com)](mailto:mgparra@bayat.com) or [Derek(dloe@bayat.com)](mailto:dloe@bayat.com) if they still work there.\n",
    "    + You can also call (+1 213-476-3863) or email [Colby(cchristy@bayat.com)](mailto:cchristy@bayat.com), a local account Manager in San Diego.\n",
    "    + We payed by providing our Credit Card Number over the phone.\n",
    "    + Both the 3:2 and 2:2 Valves Cost 81.60USD Each in April 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of Valve Controller Design\n",
    "+ Both Valves require 24V DC Current to Turn ON and Consume about 1.5W of Power or 60mA of Current.\n",
    "+ We will be using a [8-Channel Relay Board](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DR9SE4A/) Connected to an [Arduino UNO R3 Clone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EWOE0UU/) to Control the Flow of Current to the Valves.\n",
    "+ Here is a [great Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLFQ8sBWc80) that explains how this works.\n",
    "+ The 8-Channel Relay requires an Optically Isolated 5V DC Power Supply.\n",
    "+ The Arduino UNO R3 Clone can be operated using the Power from the USB Port Alone.\n",
    "+ We could have used a separate 5V Power supply to power the 8-Channel Relay. But we will be using a [DC-DC Buck Converter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081N6WWJS) to Step Down the 24V DC to 5V DC for the 8-Channel Relay instead. This way we can use a Single Power Source for all the Components.\n",
    "+ You can watch [this Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXM_xiR0o1c) to learn how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3D Printing Valve Controller Housing\n",
    "+ We used a [Bambu Lab X1 Carbon](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon?variant=42698346070152) to print the Housing.\n",
    "    + 0.4mm Nozzle\n",
    "    + Textured PEI Plate \n",
    "+ We generated a [3MF File](CAD_Files/Valve%20Controller/Valve%20Relay%20Controller%20Housing.3mf) with all the Settings we used for the Print. You can open this file on the [Orca Slicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases).\n",
    "+ The Original STEP Files and F3D Files can be found in [this directory](CAD_Files/Valve%20Controller).\n",
    "+ We recommend getting a [3D Printing Accessories Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VBNDF95/) if you haven't purchased one already.\n",
    "    + Its extremely helpful in removing supports and cleaning up the print.\n",
