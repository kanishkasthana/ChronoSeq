    "### Brief Description \n",
    "\n",
    "+ For each new injection of beads for the ChronoSeq Device:\n",
    "    + We need to make sure the beads from the previous injection are recovered and removed from the Bead Channel.\n",
    "    + By removing the beads we can ensure the Cells being injected in the the microfluidic chip are Tagged by the Correct Time-Tagged Beads.\n",
    "    + In addition we don't want to waste the substantial number of expensive Time-Tagged beads already in the Bead Channel by recovering them for use in later experiments.\n",
    "    + Therefore we deposit the recovered beads in labeled 50ml and 15ml Tubes using the XYZ Robot and the Bead Bypass Valve.\n",
    "+ To Build the XYZ Robot we will modify a [GRBL](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki) [CoreXY Pen-Plotter](https://www.doesbot.com/corexy-pen-plotter/45-doesbot-a4-working-area-xy-plotter-printer-handwriting-writer-drawing-robot-kit-corexy-structure-assemble-needed-diy-cnc.html).\n",
    "+ Although we modified the Doesbot plotter there are many other similar plotters available online and the provided [CAD Files](CAD_Files/XYZ%20Robot) can easily be modified for those other Plotters. Most Pen Plotters meant for A4 Size Paper should work.\n",

    "### 3D Printing Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We used a [Bambu Lab X1 Carbon](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon?variant=42698346070152) to print the Parts.\n",
    "    + 0.4mm Nozzle\n",
    "    + Textured PEI Plate \n",
    "+ We generated several [3MF Files](CAD_Files/XYZ%20Robot) with all the Settings we used for the Print. You can open these files on the [Orca Slicer](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases).\n",
    "+ The Original STEP Files and F3D Files can be found in the same directory.\n",
    "+ We recommend getting a [3D Printing Accessories Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VBNDF95/) if you haven't purchased one already.\n",
    "    + Its extremely helpful in removing supports and cleaning up the print.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Ordering the Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "+ You can order the Doesbot AX4 from either [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHW97N9W) or directly from the [Doesbot website](https://www.doesbot.com/corexy-pen-plotter/45-doesbot-a4-working-area-xy-plotter-printer-handwriting-writer-drawing-robot-kit-corexy-structure-assemble-needed-diy-cnc.html).\n",
